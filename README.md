# gameidea
idea: There's a fish in the ocean that is hungry. It's swimming around the ocean and can eat the smaller fish, but it has to watch out for the shark because it can get eaten by the shark.
Characters:
-fish swimming around
-small fishies that can be eaten
-shark (bad guy you will want to avoid)
Goal: to eat as many fish as possible without getting eaten by the shark. You will have to beat your previous record.
Levels: there could be a easy and hard mode where in the hard mode there's more sharks
Inspiration: I played a similar game as a kid with a fish trying to eat the smaller fish
Skills I look for in teammate: 
-will put in effort into the project
-can manage their time and won't procastinate this project
